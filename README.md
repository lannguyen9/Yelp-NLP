# "Sentiment Analysis on the Yelp Dataset"

In this project, I explore and compare two machine learnings models on the Yelp Dataset (version 7). The code is meant to be my coding notes so the reader can follow along with my thought process.

The Results notebook is an aggregate of the previous jupyter notebooks and is not meant to be run as a script.

For future work, I will create functions to streamline the project.
